This data consists of different things like number of viewers, number of active viewers, followers gained and many other relevant columns regarding a particular streamer. It has 11 different columns with all the necessary information that is needed.


I tried my hand at analysis of this dataset and created my own model which can predict the number of followers that a channel can have based on some input parameters.
